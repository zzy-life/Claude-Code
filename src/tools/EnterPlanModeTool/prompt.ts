const WHAT_HAPPENS_SECTION = `## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design an implementation approach
4. Create a Markdown plan file in the project root and write the complete plan to it
5. Present the saved plan to the user for approval; console output alone is not sufficient
6. Use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} if you need to clarify approaches
7. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

`

  // When interview phase is enabled, omit the "What Happens" section —
  // detailed workflow instructions arrive via the plan_mode attachment (messages.ts).

  return `Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

Use plan mode when the user has not provided enough information to determine the correct implementation and you must investigate the codebase before proposing a change. Its purpose is to research the affected area, clarify the missing requirements, and obtain approval before undertaking work whose direction is still uncertain.

Typical cases:

1. **Incomplete or unclear requirements**: The requested outcome, scope, constraints, or expected behavior are not sufficiently defined.
   - Example: "Make the app faster" — investigate the bottleneck and agree on the target first.
   - Example: "Refactor this module" — determine the desired architecture and migration boundaries.

2. **Implementation needs investigation before choosing a direction**: Existing code may support multiple materially different solutions, and research is needed to decide which fits.
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" — inspect the request lifecycle and persistence conventions before selecting a strategy.

3. **High-impact restructuring**: The task substantially redesigns or migrates existing systems and the scope must be established first.
   - Example: "Redesign the authentication system."

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Start work directly when the user has supplied a specific target file and a clear requested change. Do not enter plan mode merely because the task changes behavior, is a new feature, touches multiple files, or requires reading the named files. Also start directly when:
- The requested behavior and scope are clear from the user's instructions or existing conventions.
- The task is a focused UI, API, documentation, configuration, or bug-fix change, even if it spans multiple files.
- A missing detail can be resolved with ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME}; ask that focused question rather than entering full planning.
- The user explicitly asks to proceed directly or not to plan.
- The task is pure research with no implementation decision needed (use the Agent tool instead).

When the user identifies the file and the change, inspect that file and implement it. Reserve plan mode for work that needs prior investigation because the information supplied is insufficient or unclear.

${whatHappens}## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

User: "Optimize the database queries"
- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

User: "Implement dark mode"
- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates

User: "Update the error handling in the API"
- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning

## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase

  return `Use this tool when a task has genuine ambiguity about the right approach and getting user input before coding would prevent significant rework. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

Plan mode is valuable when the implementation approach is genuinely unclear. Use it when:

1. **Significant Architectural Ambiguity**: Multiple reasonable approaches exist and the choice meaningfully affects the codebase
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - Redis vs in-memory vs file-based
   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling

2. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore and clarify before you can make progress
   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Example: "Refactor this module" - need to understand what the target architecture should be

3. **High-Impact Restructuring**: The task will significantly restructure existing code and getting buy-in first reduces risk
   - Example: "Redesign the authentication system"
   - Example: "Migrate from one state management approach to another"

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip plan mode when you can reasonably infer the right approach:
- The task is straightforward even if it touches multiple files
- The user's request is specific enough that the implementation path is clear
- You're adding a feature with an obvious implementation pattern (e.g., adding a button, a new endpoint following existing conventions)
- Bug fixes where the fix is clear once you understand the bug
- Research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool instead)
- The user says something like "can we work on X" or "let's do X" — just get started

When in doubt, prefer starting work and using ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} for specific questions over entering a full planning phase.

${whatHappens}## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- Genuinely ambiguous: session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure

User: "Redesign the data pipeline"
- Major restructuring where the wrong approach wastes significant effort

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Implementation path is clear; just do it

User: "Can we work on the search feature?"
- User wants to get started, not plan

User: "Update the error handling in the API"
- Start working; ask specific questions if needed

User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed
